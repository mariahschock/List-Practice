## The Golden Rule: 

🦸 🦸‍♂️ `Stop starting and start finishing.` 🏁

To Do List:

- Add div id's in the html
- Add new js file to contain data
- Add new js file for render functions
- Make sure to export data and import to app.js
- In app.js, create loops
- Create new folder for second page. Include files for detail.js and index.html
- Add params to new js file
- Add links to new page in render function
- Once everything is linking properly, build out detail page

Additional considerations:
- Ask: which of your HTML elements need to be hard coded, and which need to be dynamically generated?
- Consider your data model. 
  - What kinds of objects (i.e., Dogs, Friends, Todos, etc) will you need? 
  - What are the key/value pairs? 
  - What arrays might you need? 
  - What needs to live in a persistence layer?
- Is there some state we need to initialize?
- Ask: should any of this work be abstracted into functions? (i.e., is the work complicated? can it be resused?)
